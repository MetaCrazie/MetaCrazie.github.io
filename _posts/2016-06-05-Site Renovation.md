It has been a while since I came back to this site, and it looked pretty desolate out here.
So, **drum rolls** time for a massive renovation!

The areas that I've renovated as of now include:
- Main page
  - Added mobile responsiveness
  - Material makeover
- Blog page
  - Added mobile responsiveness
  - Material makeover (card view for posts)
- Post page
  - Change in overall design
  - Material makeover (still underway)
  
The areas that still need work:
- About page
- Credits

Going on to further criticism, here's a list of immediate concerns:
1.  Default header space above posts.
2.  Displaying multiple posts
3.  Displaying next read post suggestions
4.  Make the home page more inviting (looks too blank, eh?)
5.  Header and footer renovation
6.  Text margins in post card
Of course, there are MANY areas for improvement...but you gotta start somewhere, right?


Well, a fair amount to do, so I should get going!
