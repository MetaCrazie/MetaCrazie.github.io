It has been a while since I came back to this site, and it looked pretty desolate out here.
So, **drum rolls** time for a massive renovation!

The areas that I've renovated as of now include:
- Main page
  - Added mobile responsiveness
  - Material makeover
- Blog page
  - Added mobile responsiveness
  - Material makeover (card view for posts)
- Post page
  - Change in overall design
  - Material makeover (still underway)
  
The areas that still need work:
- About page
- Credits

Going on to further criticism, the header and footer need work and the welcome page needs to be more inviting.

Well, a fair amount to do, so I should get going!
