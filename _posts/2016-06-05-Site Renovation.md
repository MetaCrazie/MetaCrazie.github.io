It has been a while since I came back to this site, and it looked pretty desolate out here.
So, **drum rolls** time for a massive renovation!

The areas that I've renovated as of now include:
- Main page
  - Added mobile responsiveness
  - Material makeover
- Blog page
  - Added mobile responsiveness
  - Material makeover (card view for posts)
- Post page
  - Change in overall design
  - Material makeover (still underway)
  
The areas that still need work:
- About page
- Credits

Going on to further criticism, here's a list of immediate concerns:
-  Default header space above posts.
-  Displaying multiple posts
-  Displaying next read post suggestions
-  Make the home page more inviting (looks too blank, eh?)
-  Header and footer renovation
-  Text margins in post card
Of course, there are MANY areas for improvement...but you gotta start somewhere, right?


Well, a fair amount to do, so I should get going!
