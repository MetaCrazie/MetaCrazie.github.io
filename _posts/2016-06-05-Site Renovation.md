<p>It has been a while since I came back to this site, and it looked pretty desolate out here.
So, <em>drum rolls</em> time for a massive renovation!</p>

<p>The areas that I've renovated as of now include:</p>
<centre>
<p>- Main page</p>
<p>  - Added mobile responsiveness</p>
<p>  - Material makeover</p>
<p>- Blog page</p>
<p>  - Added mobile responsiveness</p>
<p>  - Material makeover (card view for posts)</p>
<p>- Post page</p>
<p>  - Change in overall design</p>
<p>  - Material makeover (still underway)</p>
</centre>  
<p>The areas that still need work:
<p>- About page</p>
<p>- Credits</p>
</p>
Going on to further criticism, here's a list of immediate concerns:
<centre>
<p>-  Default header space above posts.</p>
<p>-  Displaying multiple posts</p>
<p>-  Displaying next read post suggestions</p>
<p>-  Make the home page more inviting (looks too blank, eh?)</p>
<p>-  Header and footer renovation</p>
<p>-  Text margins in post card</p>
Of course, there are MANY areas for improvement...but you gotta start somewhere, right?


Well, a fair amount to do, so I should get going!
